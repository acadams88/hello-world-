1. I am a woman
2. I am a mother
3. I am very intelligent.
4. I am probably a genius that is just tapping into it. So return here in a couple years to see what great things I have done
5. I have just learned that markdown language does not have spell check, so maybe my genius is quwestionable. :bowtie:

**This is an inspirational quote**
*Everything is hard until you do it, then its not.*
